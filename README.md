# Using the Brand Alert API 2.0 web service

[Brand Alert API](https://brand-alert-api.whoisxmlapi.com) searches 
across all recently registered and deleted domain names, and returns result 
sets consisting of domains that contain the specified terms.

Here you'll find examples of querying the API implemented in multiple
languages.

You'll need a
[WhoisXmlApi account](https://brand-alert-api.whoisxmlapi.com/signup) to
authenticate.

Please, refer to the
[Brand Alert API User Guide](https://brand-alert-api.whoisxmlapi.com/docs) for
info on input parameters, request/response formats, authentication
instructions and more.
